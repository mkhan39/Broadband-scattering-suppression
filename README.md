. To test and explore you would need a data file containing optical parameters for the dielctric core (i.e., refractive index) and metallic nanoparticles (i.e., refractive index, extinction). One such data file (.csv ) is included in this project for experimentally measured 11 nm plasmonic gold thin film.
