# Broadband-scattering-suppression
Mathematical description and related computation of the broadband scattering suppression project 
Computational method and related codes shown here is a part of the published work. The publication can be found in the following link https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-28-15-22732&id=433552
To test and explore you would need a data file containing optical parameters for the dielctric core (i.e., refractive index) and metallic nanoparticles (i.e., refractive index, extinction). One such data file (.csv ) is included in this project.
